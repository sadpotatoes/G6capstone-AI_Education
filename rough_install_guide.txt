Install Steps:

Assuming using Visual Studio Code or similar and have python installed and setup
While in project folder open the terminal and run 

	python -m venv env

Install required software:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install flask
pip install Flask-WTF
pip install Flask-bootstrap
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install boto3

Now that everything is installed run command
$env:FLASK_APP = "flask_app"
This changes the name of the flask apps default program to flask_app 

Now to run the app use:
	python -m flask run
	
This should output something like
* Serving Flask app "flask_app"
 * Environment: production
 	  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 	  Use a production WSGI server instead.
 	* Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
At this point copy and paste the http: line into your favourite internet browser and it should be running the site

Also, in case it canâ€™t find the flask_app file it could be an issues with the layout of you project folder. Mine looks like this and seems to work.



Basically I extracted the github zip into my environment and then pull everything up a level (If you want to skip doing that just make G6capstone-AI_Education-main your environment folder).
