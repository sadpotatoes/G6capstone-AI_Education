Install Steps
Assuming using Visual Studio Code or similar, have python 3 installed and setup and on windows
While in project folder open the terminal and run 
	python -m venv env
Install required software
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install flask
python -m pip install Flask-WTF
python -m pip install Flask-bootstrap
python -m pip install sklearn
python -m pip install pandas
python -m pip install boto3
python -m pip install fsspec
python -m pip install s3fs
At this point you might need to reinstall boto3 in s3fs uninstalled it

Now that everything is installed run command
$env:FLASK_APP = "flask_app"
If running from cmd line instead of IDE use 
	set FLASK_APP=flask_app
This changes the name of the flask apps default program to flask_app 
Now to run the app use
	python -m flask run
This should output something like
* Serving Flask app "flask_app"
 * Environment: production
 	  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 	  Use a production WSGI server instead.
 	* Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
At this point copy and paste the http: line into your favourite internet browser and it should be running the site

Also, in case it can’t find the flask_app file it could be an issues with the layout of you project folder. Mine looks like this and seems to work.



Basically I extracted the github zip into my environment and then pull everything up a level (If you want to skip doing that just make G6capstone-AI_Education-main your environment folder).



Following tutorial at: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database
For creation of the database you’ll need 2 more pip installs
	python -m pip install flask-sqlalchemy
	python -m pip install flask-migrate
	(flask-migrate is used for updating the structure of the database incase revisions are necessary)
You'll also need to install Flask-login
	python -m pip install flask-login








!!!DO NOT FOLLOW THIS SECTION ALREADY GENERATED CODE WILL BE UPLOADED!!!
To create the database (using code from github) run these commands 
	python -m flask db init
This should output something like 
Creating directory C: … done
Creating directory C: ...  done
Generating C: ...  done
Generating C: ...  done
Generating C: ...  done
Generating C: ...  done
Please edit configuration/connection/logging settings in 'C:’ before preceding 
python -m flask db migrate -m "users table"
This should output
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'user'
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added index 'ix_user_email' on '['email']'
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added index 'ix_user_nickname' on '['nickname']'
Generating C: …\migrations\versions\79cc6c580ecc_users_table.py ...  done
This merged the database with a new one “users table” (doesn’t exist)
NOTE “users table” is the name of the database
To update the database you’ll need need to use “python -m flask db upgrade” not migrate
