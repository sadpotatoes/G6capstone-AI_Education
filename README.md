# Ag-AI
Capstone Project

The goal of this project is to build trust in farmers on the idea of artificial intelligence. We plan to do this by allowing the user to interact with an active learning system, providing information to a machine learning algorithm and seeing how their input changes the accuracy of the algorithm.

The CapstoneMain is used to run this project. Images folder is used to hold all images. Images must be separated by classification by adding a folder that holds all images of the classification. There must be a path to each file in master to run this program.

The user will interact with a web-based user interface, where they’ll be asked to label pictures of corn as either healthy or unhealthy. 


Install Steps\
Assuming using Visual Studio Code or similar, have python 3 installed and setup and on windows\
While in project folder open the terminal and run \
	python -m venv env\
Install required software\
python -m pip install --upgrade pip\
python -m pip install flask\
python -m pip install Flask-WTF\
python -m pip install Flask-bootstrap\
python -m pip install sklearn\
python -m pip install pandas\
python -m pip install boto3\
python -m pip install fsspec\
python -m pip install s3fs\
At this point you might need to reinstall boto3 in case s3fs uninstalled it\

Now that everything is installed run command\
$env:FLASK_APP = "flask_app"\
If running from cmd line instead of IDE use \
	set FLASK_APP=flask_app\
This changes the name of the flask apps default program to flask_app \
Now to run the app use\
	python -m flask run\
This should output something like\
* Serving Flask app "flask_app"\
 * Environment: production\
 	  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.\
 	  Use a production WSGI server instead.\
 	* Debug mode: off\
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\
At this point copy and paste the http: line into your favourite internet browser and it should be running the site\



Following tutorial at: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database  
For creation of the database you’ll need 2 more pip installs\
	python -m pip install flask-sqlalchemy\
	python -m pip install flask-migrate\
	(flask-migrate is used for updating the structure of the database incase revisions are necessary)\
To create the database (using code from github) run these commands \
	python -m flask db init\
This should output something like\
Creating directory C: … done\
Creating directory C: ...  done\
Generating C: ...  done\
Generating C: ...  done\
Generating C: ...  done\
Generating C: ...  done\
Please edit configuration/connection/logging settings in 'C:’ before preceding\
python -m flask db migrate -m "users table"\
This should output\
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.\
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.\
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'user'\
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added index 'ix_user_email' on '['email']'\
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added index 'ix_user_nickname' on '['nickname']'\
Generating C: …\migrations\versions\79cc6c580ecc_users_table.py ...  done\
This command does nothing but generate the new database script, in order to apply it you need to run\
\
python -m flask db upgrade\
which should output \
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.\
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.\
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 3e51231f2134, users table\
\
NOTE 'users table' is just the name of the update it could be called anything.\
